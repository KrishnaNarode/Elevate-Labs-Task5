This project demonstrates creating a simple relational database using MySQL, containing two related tables: Customers and Orders. It also showcases different types of SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).

Database Structure:
Customers: Stores customer details (ID, name, city).
Orders: Stores order details (ID, date, amount, customer reference).

SQL Operations:

1. Create database and tables.
2. Insert sample data.
3. Perform different joins to demonstrate data retrieval:

INNER JOIN: Returns matching records from both tables.
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either table.
